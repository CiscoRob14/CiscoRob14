- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CiscoRob14 (Robert Novak)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a product manager at Cisco, but this isn't an official Cisco repo. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: robnovak
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm not the dead guy from the Chicago Sun Times or the tier 4 support guy from SGI from the 90s or the MIPS / Pyramid / Sun guy (although I overlapped with him at Sun a few years back).
